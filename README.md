# Telegram &times; HeyMetra

**Link a Telegram chat to your workspace.**

An answer nobody reads is not an answer. Have it delivered to Telegram, where the team already is.

## Connect Telegram

1. Create a bot with @BotFather in Telegram and copy the token it gives you.
2. Paste the token here, then open your new bot and press Start — that private chat is now linked.
3. Send the test message from HeyMetra to confirm the link works.

## Then add HeyMetra to your assistant

Add HeyMetra once and it is there in every conversation. The address is the same everywhere:

```
https://mcp.heymetra.com/mcp
```

### One command

```bash
npx add-mcp https://mcp.heymetra.com/mcp
```

[`add-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/add-mcp) is a third-party installer that writes the configuration for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, VS Code and seventeen other agents. It infers the name from the address, so the server lands as `heymetra`. Run against this endpoint before it was written here.

### Or by hand

<details>
<summary><b>Claude</b> — Settings → Customize → Connectors → Add custom connector</summary>

Paste the address above into Settings → Customize → Connectors → Add custom connector.

_On Team and Enterprise plans only an owner can add it, under Organization settings._

Full walkthrough: [heymetra.com/mcp/claude/](https://heymetra.com/mcp/claude/)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ChatGPT</b> — Settings → Security and login → Developer mode, then chatgpt.com/plugins</summary>

Paste the address above into Settings → Security and login → Developer mode, then chatgpt.com/plugins.

_The endpoint has to include its /mcp path here._

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Grok</b> — grok.com/connectors → New Connector → Custom</summary>

Paste the address above into grok.com/connectors → New Connector → Custom.

_XAI calls this “bring your own MCP”._

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Perplexity</b> — Settings → Connectors → Custom connector → Remote</summary>

_Perplexity documents it as a Pro, Max and Enterprise feature._

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b> — claude mcp add --transport http</summary>

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http heymetra https://mcp.heymetra.com/mcp
```

_Or a .mcp.json in the project root; /mcp inside a session shows what connected._

Full walkthrough: [heymetra.com/mcp/claude-code/](https://heymetra.com/mcp/claude-code/)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex</b> — ~/.codex/config.toml</summary>

```toml
[mcp_servers.heymetra]
url = "https://mcp.heymetra.com/mcp"
```

_Under an [mcp_servers.<name>] section, then codex mcp login._

Full walkthrough: [heymetra.com/mcp/codex/](https://heymetra.com/mcp/codex/)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b> — ~/.cursor/mcp.json, or .cursor/mcp.json in a project</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "heymetra": { "url": "https://mcp.heymetra.com/mcp" }
  }
}
```

_Leave the static OAuth fields empty — they exist for servers that cannot register themselves._

Full walkthrough: [heymetra.com/mcp/cursor/](https://heymetra.com/mcp/cursor/)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Antigravity</b> — ~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json, or .agents/mcp_config.json in a project</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "heymetra": { "serverUrl": "https://mcp.heymetra.com/mcp" }
  }
}
```

_The key is serverUrl, not url — the one every other JSON client spells differently._

## What it may and may not touch

Send a message to the linked Telegram chat — proposed first, with the exact text, and sent only once you approve. It cannot be recalled.

Permissions are switched on per connection, and one you leave off is a tool your assistant never sees.

| Permission | What it covers | Changes anything? |
|---|---|---|
| **Send messages** | Let your assistant send to this chat, with your approval each time. Turn it off and only the test button can reach it. | Yes — every change waits for your approval |

<details>
<summary>What each permission lets an assistant do, in full</summary>

- Send a message to the linked Telegram chat — proposed first, with the exact text, and sent only once you approve. It cannot be recalled.
</details>

Anything that would change something comes back as a proposal you approve, inside bounds that live in code rather than in a prompt: at most 20 messages a rolling day, counted separately from account changes, and an approval that expires after 30 minutes. [How that works](https://heymetra.com/security/).

## What HeyMetra reads from Telegram

Connect your own bot and press Start to link the chat, then send a test message from HeyMetra to confirm it arrives. After that, your assistant can send to that same chat — it shows you the exact text first and nothing is sent until you approve it. Whoever is in that chat sees it, and a sent message cannot be recalled. Nothing is ever read from Telegram.

<details>
<summary>About Telegram</summary>

Telegram is a channel you own: HeyMetra reaches you through a bot you create, in the chat you link it to.
</details>

## One connection, not seven
